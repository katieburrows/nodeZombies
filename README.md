                                       ğŸ§ŸğŸ§ŸğŸ§Ÿ Node Zombies ğŸ§ŸğŸ§ŸğŸ§Ÿ
The app uses the inquirer NPM package and the CLI to ask the user to choose between 1-5.  The user's entry is compared with a randomly generated zombieNumber between 1-5.  If the user's entry is the same as the zombieNumber then the user wins the round and inflicts a randomly generated amount of damage to the zombie's health.  The opposite happens when the user doesn't match the zombieNumber.  If the user or the zombie gets to 0 health (or less) then the game is over.  If the user wins (the zombie reaches 0 (or less) health), they get to keep their brainzz, if the user loses (reaches 0 (or less) health), then sad news because their brainzz are getting chomped on.
